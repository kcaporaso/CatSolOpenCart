We need to copy these over when creating a new "silver" level store:
I will automate this once we go into "slow" mode.

Put a store_code prefix in front of each file:

1. Icons for headers:
 - icon_category.png 
 - icon_bestsellers.png
 - icon_brand.png
 - icon_information.png
 - icon_search.png

2. TPL / Stylesheet
 - common/header.tpl
 - stylesheet/STORE_stylesheet.php

3. For staging on catsolonline.com, setup a new A record pointing to :  storename.catsolonline.com
   Then add that to apache so it will handle the staging name.

4. Add a store in the backoffice as a Top Administrator
   Make sure you create a User for the store first as the owner of the store must be designated.

5. Import each Catalog Data set to that store as a Top Administrator.
